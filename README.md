This is a notebook for a now-concluded challenge posted on Kaggle. The dataset provided was from a marketing campaign conducted by a bank to encourage individuals to sign up for a term deposit. The challenge was to build a model to be able to predict whether or not a given individual will sign up for a term subscription if contacted as part of this marketing campaign.

Please have a look - feel free to use this notebook for your own reference too! My motivation behind this project was to use some of the models I have been experimenting with recently as well as to exhibit certain skills picked up from a Coursera module I participated in.

At the end of this notebook, based on the insights generated by the model, I also provide suggestions on types of individuals to approach to increase the effectiveness of this campaign.

Kindly note any views expressed are my own.
